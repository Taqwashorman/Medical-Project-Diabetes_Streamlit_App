## Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning Models (RandomForest, SVM, etc.)

### Project Overview:

This project aims to improve the accuracy of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for diabetes prediction. Initially, the model achieved 74% accuracy. The objective is to enhance performance to at least 85% by applying various data preprocessing, feature engineering, and optimization techniques.

### Dataset:

The dataset used for this project contains medical records and diagnostic measurements related to diabetes. The dataset includes features such as: 
Pregnancies 
,Glucose 
,Blood Pressure 
,Skin Thickness 
,Insulin 
,BMI (Body Mass Index) 
,Diabetes Pedigree Function 
,Age 
,Outcome (0 = No Diabetes, 1 = Diabetes)

### Tasks & Methodology:

1. Data Analysis & Preprocessing

Identify missing values and apply appropriate imputation techniques.

Detect and handle outliers using statistical methods.

Check for class imbalance and apply resampling techniques if necessary.

Normalize/scale numerical features for better model performance.

2. Feature Engineering
   
Perform correlation analysis to remove redundant features.

Create new meaningful features if needed.

Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality (if required).


3. Model Optimization
   
Tune hyperparameters using Grid Search or Random Search.

Experiment with different kernel functions (linear, RBF, polynomial).

Use feature selection techniques to improve model efficiency.

4. Model Evaluation
   
Assess the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

Perform cross-validation to ensure generalization.

### Results & Findings

After implementing the above techniques, the goal is to achieve an accuracy of at least 85% while maintaining a balanced trade-off between precision and recall.


# Conclusion

This project showcases the impact of effective data preprocessing, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning on improving machine learning model performance. The optimized SVM model is expected to provide more reliable predictions for diabetes diagnosis.
